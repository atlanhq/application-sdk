# 📚 Host SDK Python Reference Documentation Publicly

## 📝 Summary
Host the Application SDK's Python reference documentation on a public URL, similar to Temporal's documentation, to improve developer accessibility and adoption.

## 💡 Basic Example
```
Current: Local pydoctor browsing only
Proposed: Public hosted documentation

Potential URLs:
- https://apps.atlan.com/sdk/api/
- https://appframework.atlan.com/api/
- https://sdk.atlan.dev/python/

Similar to:
- https://python.temporal.io/
- https://k.atlan.dev/application-sdk/api/ (internal)
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Developer Accessibility**: Easy access to API documentation without local setup
- **Adoption**: Lower barrier to entry for SDK adoption
- **Reference**: Quick lookup of classes, functions, and usage patterns
- **Professional**: Provide professional-grade documentation experience
- **SEO**: Improve discoverability of SDK capabilities

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Choose hosting platform and URL structure
- [ ] Set up automated documentation generation pipeline
- [ ] Configure pydoctor or similar tool for public documentation
- [ ] Design documentation website layout and navigation
- [ ] Add search functionality for API reference
- [ ] Include code examples and usage patterns
- [ ] Set up automated updates with SDK releases
- [ ] Add cross-linking between guides and API reference
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile access
- [ ] Add analytics to track documentation usage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Automated generation from docstrings using pydoctor or Sphinx
- CI/CD integration for automatic updates
- Static site hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or custom)
- Search indexing for API reference
- Integration with existing documentation structure

## 🌐 Hosting Options
1. **GitHub Pages**: Free, integrated with repository
2. **Netlify/Vercel**: Enhanced features and performance
3. **Custom Domain**: Professional branding (apps.atlan.com, etc.)
4. **CDN Integration**: Global performance optimization

## 🔗 Current State
Currently developers run pydoctor locally to browse classes and functions, which is not scalable for external developers.
