# 🔄 Improve State Management with Multiple Workers

## 📝 Summary
Currently state management in case of multiple workers isn't intuitive. Improve the state management system to handle multiple workers effectively and provide clear patterns for developers.

## 💡 Current Issues
```python
# Current: State management with multiple workers is unclear
# - Shared state between workers is not well-defined
# - No clear patterns for worker coordination
# - State synchronization issues
# - Unclear worker lifecycle management
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Scalability**: Enable applications to scale with multiple workers
- **State Consistency**: Ensure consistent state across all workers
- **Developer Clarity**: Provide clear patterns for multi-worker applications
- **Production Ready**: Support enterprise-scale deployments with multiple workers
- **Coordination**: Better worker coordination and communication

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current state management implementation
- [ ] Design improved multi-worker state management architecture
- [ ] Implement shared state mechanisms (Redis, database, or in-memory)
- [ ] Create worker coordination patterns
- [ ] Add worker discovery and health monitoring
- [ ] Implement state synchronization mechanisms
- [ ] Create configuration options for multi-worker setups
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] Create tests for multi-worker scenarios
- [ ] Add monitoring and debugging tools for worker state

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Shared state store (Redis, database, or distributed cache)
- Worker registration and discovery mechanism
- State synchronization protocols
- Conflict resolution for concurrent state updates
- Worker health monitoring and failover
- Configuration management for worker coordination
- Graceful shutdown and state cleanup

## 💡 Proposed Solutions
- Implement distributed state management using Redis or similar
- Add worker registry for coordination
- Create state locking mechanisms for critical sections
- Implement event-driven state updates
- Add worker-to-worker communication channels
