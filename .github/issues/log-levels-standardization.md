# 📋 Log Levels Standardization Across Modules

## 📝 Summary
Fix incorrect log levels throughout the SDK modules where ERROR is used for recoverable issues that should be WARNING, and metrics are logged at WARNING that should be DEBUG.

## 💡 Current Issues
```python
# ❌ Current problematic patterns:
# ERROR for recoverable issues
logger.error("Retrying connection after failure")  # Should be WARNING
logger.error("Cache miss, fetching from source")   # Should be DEBUG

# WARNING for metrics/debug info
logger.warning(f"Processing {count} records")      # Should be DEBUG
logger.warning("Query execution time: 1.2s")       # Should be DEBUG

# Object store particularly problematic
logger.error("Retrying upload after network error") # Should be WARNING
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Log Quality**: Ensure logs provide meaningful signal vs noise
- **Alerting**: Prevent false alerts from misclassified log levels
- **Debugging**: Make it easier to find actual errors vs normal operations
- **Monitoring**: Proper log levels enable better monitoring and alerting
- **Object Store**: Particularly problematic with error logs for normal retry behavior

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit all modules for incorrect log level usage
- [ ] Create logging standards documentation (reference existing logging.mdc rules)
- [ ] Fix ERROR logs that should be WARNING (recoverable issues)
- [ ] Fix WARNING logs that should be DEBUG (metrics, verbose info)
- [ ] Pay special attention to object store module retry behavior
- [ ] Add linting rules to prevent future log level misuse
- [ ] Update existing logging guidelines
- [ ] Add examples of proper log level usage
- [ ] Test log output in different scenarios

## 🔧 Logging Level Guidelines
- **ERROR**: Unrecoverable errors that require immediate attention
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues that may need investigation
- **INFO**: Important application lifecycle events
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging purposes

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- Object store retry mechanisms (currently logging errors for normal retries)
- Database connection retry logic
- Workflow execution status updates
- Metrics and performance data
- Cache operations and misses
