# Make sure you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
gh auth login

# Run the creation script
cd .github/issues
python create-v0.2.0-issues.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation
You can manually create issues by copying the content from each markdown file into GitHub's issue creation interface.

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI Directly
```bash
# Example for creating a single issue
gh issue create --title "Docker Base Image Security Improvements" --body-file docker-base-image-security.md --label "v0.2.0,enhancement,security"
```

## üìä Milestone Planning

All issues should be added to the **v0.2.0** milestone for tracking and planning purposes.

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels Used

- `v0.2.0` - Release milestone
- `enhancement` - New features and improvements  
- `bug` - Issues that need fixing
- `security` - Security-related improvements
- `performance` - Performance optimizations
- `developer-experience` - DX improvements
- `breaking-change` - Changes that may break existing code

## üìÖ Next Steps

1. Create the issues using one of the methods above
2. Create a v0.2.0 milestone in GitHub
3. Assign issues to the milestone
4. Prioritize issues based on impact and effort
5. Add due dates and assignees as needed
6. Begin development work on prioritized items
