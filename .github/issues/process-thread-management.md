# ⚡ Effective Processes and Threads Management

## 📝 Summary
Improve processes and threads management in the Application SDK to address ineffective uvloop implementation, idle/stale threads, scaling issues, and blocked event loops.

## 💡 Current Issues
```python
# Current problems:
# 1. Despite using uvloop as asyncio alternative, implementation is ineffective
# 2. Many threads remain idle/stale  
# 3. Processes can't scale properly
# 4. Event loop likely blocked by synchronous operations
# 5. Severely limits SDK's ability to handle production workloads
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Production Readiness**: Enable SDK to handle production workloads effectively
- **Performance**: Eliminate idle/stale threads and improve resource utilization
- **Scalability**: Allow processes to scale properly under load
- **Event Loop Efficiency**: Prevent blocking of the event loop
- **Resource Management**: Better management of system resources

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit current thread and process management implementation
- [ ] Identify synchronous operations blocking the event loop
- [ ] Fix uvloop integration and ensure proper async/await usage
- [ ] Implement proper thread pool management
- [ ] Add process scaling mechanisms
- [ ] Create monitoring for thread/process health
- [ ] Add configuration options for concurrency limits
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown and cleanup
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for concurrent operations
- [ ] Update documentation with concurrency best practices

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Proper uvloop integration and configuration
- Identification and elimination of blocking synchronous calls
- Thread pool optimization and lifecycle management
- Process pool implementation for CPU-bound tasks
- Event loop monitoring and health checks
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Graceful resource cleanup on shutdown
