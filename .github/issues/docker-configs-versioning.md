# 🐳 Centralized Docker Configuration with Version Pinning

## 📝 Summary
Create a centralized Docker configuration system where app_sdk provides versioned Dockerfiles and configurations that applications can inherit, eliminating the need for each app to maintain its own copy.

## 💡 Basic Example
```dockerfile
# Current: Each app maintains its own Dockerfile
# app1/Dockerfile, app2/Dockerfile, app3/Dockerfile (not scalable)

# Proposed: Centralized base configuration
FROM atlan/application-sdk:v0.2.0
# Apps inherit from versioned SDK base images
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: atlan/application-sdk:v0.2.0
    extends:
      file: sdk-configs/docker-compose.base.yml
      service: base-app
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Scalability**: Currently every app has a copy of Docker configs, making maintenance difficult
- **Consistency**: Ensure all apps use the same tested configurations
- **Version Management**: Pin configurations to SDK versions for stability
- **Maintenance**: Centralized updates and security patches
- **Onboarding**: Faster setup for new applications

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design centralized Docker configuration architecture
- [ ] Create base Dockerfiles for different application types (SQL, API, etc.)
- [ ] Implement version pinning mechanism
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing applications
- [ ] Update documentation with new configuration approach
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for building and publishing base images
- [ ] Test with sample applications

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges
- Backward compatibility with existing applications
- Handling application-specific customizations
- Version upgrade path for applications
