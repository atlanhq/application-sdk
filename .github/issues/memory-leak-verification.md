# üß† Memory Leak Verification with Flamegraph Monitoring

## üìù Summary
Implement easy memory monitoring and leak detection using flamegraphs, preferably through a simple decorator that outputs flamegraphs for performance analysis.

## üí° Basic Example
```python
from application_sdk.monitoring import memory_profile, flamegraph

@memory_profile
@flamegraph
async def my_workflow_activity():
    """Activity with automatic memory monitoring."""
    # Activity logic here
    pass

# Usage in application
@flamegraph(output_dir="./profiles", sample_rate=0.1)
class MyWorkflow:
    async def run(self):
        # Workflow logic with automatic profiling
        pass
```

## üéØ Motivation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Easy way to identify memory leaks and performance bottlenecks
- **Developer Experience**: Simple decorator-based approach for profiling
- **Production Ready**: Lightweight monitoring that can be enabled in production
- **Visual Analysis**: Flamegraphs provide clear visualization of memory usage patterns
- **Proactive Detection**: Catch memory leaks before they become critical issues

## üíº Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create memory profiling decorator similar to the flamegraph.py reference
- [ ] Implement flamegraph generation for memory usage
- [ ] Add CPU profiling capabilities alongside memory monitoring
- [ ] Create configuration options for sampling rates and output formats
- [ ] Integrate with existing SDK logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add documentation and examples for using profiling decorators
- [ ] Create automated memory leak detection in CI/CD
- [ ] Add performance regression detection

## üîß Technical Requirements
- Lightweight decorator that can be easily applied to functions/classes
- Configurable sampling rates to minimize performance impact
- Support for both memory and CPU profiling
- Integration with existing SDK monitoring infrastructure
- Output formats: HTML flamegraphs, JSON data, performance reports
- Minimal dependencies and overhead
