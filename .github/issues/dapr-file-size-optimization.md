# 📦 Dapr File Size (100MB) Optimization

## 📝 Summary
Optimize Dapr file size distribution to reduce the current 100MB footprint and improve application deployment times and resource usage.

## 💡 Basic Example
```bash
# Current issue: Large Dapr binaries
dapr-binary-size: ~100MB

# Proposed optimization approaches:
1. Use Dapr slim distributions
2. Implement lazy loading of Dapr components
3. Create custom Dapr builds with only required components
4. Use Dapr sidecar optimization
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- Reduce application deployment time
- Lower bandwidth requirements for application distribution
- Improve container image sizes for applications using the SDK
- Reduce storage costs and memory footprint
- Faster application startup times

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current Dapr distribution and identify size contributors
- [ ] Research Dapr optimization strategies (slim builds, component selection)
- [ ] Implement optimized Dapr distribution approach
- [ ] Measure size reduction achieved
- [ ] Update documentation with optimization guidelines
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing applications

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with all Dapr features
- Ensuring all required components are still available
- Testing across different deployment scenarios
