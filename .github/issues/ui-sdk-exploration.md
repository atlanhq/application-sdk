# 🎨 UI SDK Exploration

## 📝 Summary
Explore the development of a UI SDK component to complement the existing Application SDK, enabling developers to build user interfaces for their applications.

## 💡 Basic Example
```python
from application_sdk.ui import BaseUIComponent, Dashboard

class MetadataExtractionDashboard(Dashboard):
    """Dashboard for monitoring metadata extraction workflows."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(title="Metadata Extraction Monitor")
        self.add_component(WorkflowStatusWidget())
        self.add_component(ProgressChart())
        self.add_component(ErrorLogViewer())

# Usage
dashboard = MetadataExtractionDashboard()
app.register_ui(dashboard)
```

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Complete Platform**: Provide both backend SDK and frontend UI capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: Enable developers to build full applications with the SDK
- **Monitoring**: Provide built-in UI components for workflow monitoring and management
- **Customization**: Allow custom UI development while maintaining consistency
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Application SDK workflows

## 💼 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research UI framework options (React, Vue, or Python-based like Streamlit/Gradio)
- [ ] Define UI SDK architecture and component structure
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept UI components for common use cases
- [ ] Design integration points with existing Application SDK
- [ ] Evaluate packaging and distribution strategies
- [ ] Create documentation and examples
- [ ] Consider accessibility and responsive design requirements
- [ ] Plan for theming and customization capabilities

## 🔧 Technical Considerations
- Framework selection (web-based vs. native vs. Python-based)
- Integration with Temporal workflows for real-time updates
- State management between UI and backend workflows
- Authentication and authorization for UI components
- Deployment strategies (embedded vs. separate service)

## ❓ Unresolved Questions
- Should this be a separate package or part of the main SDK?
- What UI framework would provide the best developer experience?
- How should UI components communicate with Temporal workflows?
- What are the most common UI patterns needed by SDK users?
