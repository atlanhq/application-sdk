# Coding Standards

- Primary coding standards live in `.cursor/rules/standards.mdc` (formatting, naming, docstrings for all functions/classes/modules).
- Logging, exception, and performance guidance are in `.cursor/rules/logging.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/exception-handling.mdc`, and `.cursor/rules/performance.mdc`.
- Tooling enforcement is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (ruff, isort, pyright).
