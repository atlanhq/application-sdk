# Getting Started

!!! tip
    We use specific tools in this guide to streamline the process, you can use any tooling of your choice. for example: In this guide we use `poetry` to manage your python project.


## 0. Skip the line

If you would like to use a template to start with and skip steps 1, 2 and 3, use the [phoenix-postgres-app](https://github.com/atlanhq/phoenix-postgres-app) as a template to get started.


## 1. Setup the python project
We’ll use `poetry` to manage the project, as it simplifies dependency management and creates virtual environments automatically. If you prefer to use `pip` and `venv`, you can adapt the steps accordingly.

### Step 1: Install `poetry`
If you don’t already have `poetry` installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Once installed, you can confirm the installation by running:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### Step 2: Initialize a new project
Navigate to the directory where you want to set up your project and run:

```bash
poetry new my_workflow_app
cd my_workflow_app
```

This creates a new Python project with a basic structure, including a `pyproject.toml` file, which is the configuration file for `poetry`.

### Step 3: Add dependencies
To add `application-sdk` as a dependency, use `poetry add`:

```bash
poetry add application-sdk
```

If you need to specify a particular version, you can do so:

```bash
poetry add application-sdk@<version>
```

## 2. Setup the project strucure

Once you have initialized the project, you’ll need to set up a folder structure to organize your code, and configuration files. Below is an example structure for an application:

```{tip}
This is an opinionated structure. The `application-sdk` doesn't require any particular type of structure to use, feel free to define your own structure.
```

```
.
├── `README.md`
├── `app`
│   ├── `const.py`
│   └── `workflow.py`
├── `frontend` (optional)
│   ├── `index.html`
│   └── `script.js`
├── `main.py`
├── `Makefile`
├── `poetry.lock`
├── `pyproject.toml`
└── `tests` (optional)
    ├── `__init__.py`
    └── `unit`
```

Explanation of the structure:

 - `app`: Contains the core logic of your application, including constants and workflow definitions.
   - `const.py`: This file contains the constant SQL queries used by the workflow, such as authentication and metadata queries.
   - `workflow.py`: This file defines the logic for running the workflows. It contains the core functionality to execute the database queries defined in const.py and handle the workflow activities such as fetching and transforming data.
 - `frontend`: (Optional) If your application has a frontend, this folder would contain the frontend code. There's no constraints on the technology used, feel free to use any frontend technology you would like.
 - `main.py`: The entry point of the Python application where the server or main workflow logic is initialized.
 - `Makefile`: This file contains the commands to build, run and test the application.
 - `poetry.lock`: Automatically generated by poetry, it locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.
 - `pyproject.toml`: The configuration file for the project, specifying dependencies and project metadata.
 - `tests`: (Optional) Contains unit tests for your application.

## 3. Setup the application runtime.

To run your application, you'll configure the runtime environment using FastAPI and integrate it with the SDK. This setup includes health checks, metrics, and logging endpoints.

For detailed instructions on how to configure the application runtime, refer to this guide.

## 4. Setup the workflow application.

The app/workflow.py file will define the core workflow logic, including how it interacts with the database using the queries defined in `app/const.py`. This is where you’ll implement how the workflow fetches data and processes it.

For detailed instructions on how to build your workflow, refer to [this guide](./SQL_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md).

## 5. Setup the Makefile

Follow the instructions in [this guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/phoenix-atlan-cli/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#paas-atlan-cli---makefile-integration-and-project-setup-guide) to setup the Makefile for your application.

## 6. Run the application

Install the dependencies:
```bash
make install
```

Start the platform services:
```bash
make start-deps
```

Run the application:

```bash
make run
```
