# Custom App Frontends with Atlantis

The `frontend` directory in the app is designated to be used to add frontends for your application.

- [Frontend for Postgres App](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-postgres-app/tree/main/frontend)
- [Frontend for Hello World App](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-hello-world-app/tree/main/frontend)

You can build this frontend using Atlan's design system called [Atlantis](https://k.atlan.dev/atlantis-storybook).
