"""P-series prescription checks — AST-based.

Scans Python source for above-the-bar prescription violations (P001–P099).
Every check is purely deterministic: the same source text always produces the
same set of findings.

Each rule lives in its own module (``_unbounded_fields`` → P001,
``_category_override`` → P002, ``_error_code_prefix`` → P003, …); this
``__init__`` assembles them into the public scan + CLI API.  Adding a rule is
a new module plus one line in ``scan_text`` (for per-file rules) or a new
pass in ``scan_all`` (for cross-file rules).

Currently implemented:

* ``P001`` UnboundedContractFields — an ``Input``/``Output`` contract subclass
  declared with the ``allow_unbounded_fields=True`` class keyword.
* ``P002`` CategoryFieldOverride — a subclass of ``AppError`` (or any of its
  14 categorical leaves) that redeclares the ``category`` ``ClassVar`` in its
  own body, drifting the canonical taxonomy.  The check uses a transitive
  closure of AppError-derived class names within the file so second-generation
  overrides are caught even when the intermediate class is not in the canonical
  set.
* ``P003`` ErrorCodePrefixMismatch — a (transitive) subclass of an
  ``application_sdk.errors`` leaf class either omits its own ``code: ClassVar[str]``
  declaration or declares one that does not start with the leaf's category prefix.
  This check resolves inheritance across files via a multi-pass scan, so
  intermediate pass-through classes are flagged too.
* ``P008`` FrameworkTransferInsideTask — ``self.upload()``/``self.download()``
  called inside a ``@task``-decorated method (a framework task nested in another
  task).
* ``P009`` ManualObjectStoreConstruction — direct ``boto3`` import, ad-hoc
  ``obstore`` store construction, or a ``create_store_from_binding`` call in app
  code.
* ``P010`` ManualFileReferenceConstruction — ``FileReference(...)`` constructed
  with an SDK-managed durability field
  (``storage_path``/``is_durable``/``file_count``).
* ``P011`` RawBytesInContract — a ``bytes``/``bytearray``/``memoryview`` field on
  an ``Input``/``Output`` contract that would embed raw binary data across the
  task boundary.
* ``P012`` FilePathStringInContract — a ``str`` field on a contract whose name or
  doc marks it as a filesystem path (a worker-local reference).

the comment-only line immediately above it::
