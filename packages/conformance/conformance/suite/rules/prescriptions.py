"""Prescription rule definitions (P-series).

Above-the-bar engineering prescriptions the SDK mandates that do not fall under
a narrower category series (error-handling E, logging L, CI C, security S,
backwards-compatibility B, tests T, automation A).  Optimisations and
recommendations *below* the prescription bar live in the O-series instead.
