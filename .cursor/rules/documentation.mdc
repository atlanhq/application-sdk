Update conceptual documentation when SDK code changes.
  A file within the Application SDK has been modified: `{trigger_file_path}`.

  **Action Required:** Please review the changes in this file and update the corresponding conceptual documentation under `docs/docs/concepts/` to ensure it accurately reflects the current code. Keeping documentation synchronized with the code is crucial for maintainability.

  **Module to Concept Doc Mapping:**
  *   `application_sdk/application/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/application.md`
  *   `application_sdk/activities/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/activities.md`
  *   `application_sdk/clients/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/clients.md`
  *   `application_sdk/common/**` or `constants.py` -> `docs/docs/concepts/common.md`
  *   `application_sdk/handlers/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/handlers.md`
  *   `application_sdk/inputs/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/inputs.md`
  *   `application_sdk/outputs/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/outputs.md`
  *   `application_sdk/transformers/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/transformers.md`
  *   `application_sdk/workflows/**` -> `docs/docs/concepts/workflows.md`
  *   `application_sdk/worker.py` -> `docs/docs/concepts/worker.md`

  *(Note: Carefully examine the code changes to determine the exact impact and which documentation file(s) require updates.)*
