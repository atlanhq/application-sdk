"""App-agnostic include/exclude filter matching with uniform regex-vs-exact semantics.

SQL connectors already resolve include/exclude filters as **regex**: the filter
map is normalised to fully-anchored ``^db\\.schema$`` patterns and pushed into the
database as a POSIX ``~`` / ``!~`` ``WHERE`` clause (see
:mod:`application_sdk.common.sql_filters`). API / BI connectors (Looker, tags,
projects/folders, anything consuming the apitree dropdown) historically had **no
shared matcher** — each iterated fetched objects and did exact-id membership
(``obj.value in selected_ids``). When a filter arrives as a regex/string (the SDR
and ``object_filter`` shape) rather than a picked id, exact equality never matches,
the filter is silently dropped and the whole scope leaks (the Looker #131 class).

This module lifts the SQL path's regex semantics into a connector-agnostic,
in-process matcher so both worlds share **one** definition of "what a filter
means". A filter token is:

* an **anchored regex** by default (SDR string/regex filters), or
* an **exact literal** when ``exact=True`` (dropdown-id selection) — the token is
  ``re.escape``-d before anchoring.

The regex-vs-exact choice is therefore a *flag*, not a divergent per-connector
implementation. Matching uses :meth:`re.Pattern.fullmatch`, which anchors the
whole candidate exactly like the SQL ``~`` against an ``^...$`` pattern.

Example::

    from application_sdk.common import FilterPattern, filter_matches

    # SDR / regex filter — a model name matched against a pattern
    pattern = FilterPattern.from_filters(include_filter="^prod_.*$")
    pattern.matches("prod_sales")      # True
    pattern.matches("staging_sales")   # False  (previously leaked via exact match)

    # dropdown-id selection — exact literals
    filter_matches("my.model", include_filter=["my.model"], exact=True)  # True
    filter_matches("myXmodel", include_filter=["my.model"], exact=True)  # False

SQL connectors are unchanged — they keep pushing regex to the database via
:mod:`application_sdk.common.sql_filters`; this module serves connectors that must
match in Python.

Notes:
    * Matching uses :meth:`re.Pattern.fullmatch` (anchored). For an *unanchored*
      raw token this is stricter than the SQL POSIX ``~`` (substring): a
      connector that historically substring-matched will scope more tightly.
      Consistency with the SQL path holds because ``normalize_filters`` always
      anchors; the tighter default is the safer choice — flag it for adopters.
    * Default (regex) mode compiles caller/SDR-supplied patterns and runs
      ``fullmatch`` per candidate in-process, and Python ``re`` has no timeout, so
      a pathological pattern (e.g. ``(a+)+$``) can catastrophically backtrack.
      Filter sources are trusted connection config, so this is low-risk; do not
      feed untrusted patterns through it.
